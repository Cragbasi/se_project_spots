**Intro**

Spots – A Social Media Profile & Image Gallery Web App: Spots is a responsive social media profile and image gallery web application that I developed to showcase my ability to build dynamic, user-friendly web experiences. This project highlights my expertise in front-end development, interactive UI design, and clean coding practices while demonstrating how I structure applications for scalability and maintainability.

**Programing skills utilized**
Over the course of the project, I implemented the following web development skills in HTML and CSS:

- Media Quarries: I used media quarries, flex box, grid display, and DevTools to create a responsive design that can adapt to all media device screen widths e.g. desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
- I used the necessary styles in CSS to : 1. handle overflow of a single line of text 2. activate the finger-icon cursor response and other interactions to the user's mouse pointer and hover state over GUI elements 3. import and display images 4. import and dsiplay unique font styles from Google Fonts. 5. and create interactive user buttons for editing their social media page.

Key Features & Functionality
• User Profile & Image Gallery – A clean, intuitive layout displaying a user’s profile and curated image collection.
• Profile Editing with Modal Popup – A smooth, interactive modal enables profile updates without disrupting the page.
• New Post Feature – Users can dynamically add images to their gallery with seamless integration.
• Form Validation – Built-in validation ensures proper input handling, preventing errors before submission.
• Responsive & Interactive UI – Designed for optimal display across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Technology & Development Approach

This project is structured using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following best practices for code organization and maintainability.
• JavaScript (ES6+) Modules & OOP – The application is built using a modular structure with JS classes, making the code reusable and scalable.
• CSS & BEM Methodology – Styling follows the Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) approach, ensuring structured and maintainable CSS.
• Responsive Design – Implemented CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries for an adaptive layout across all screen sizes.
• Interactive UI Components – The modal pop-up, hover effects, and click-based interactions are powered by JavaScript and CSS animations.
• Form Validation – Custom JavaScript validation ensures user-friendly and error-free input handling.

Scalability & Backend Considerations

While this project is currently front-end focused, I designed it with future scalability in mind. If expanded into a full-stack application, I would integrate:
• Node.js & Express.js – To manage backend logic and API endpoints.
• MongoDB or PostgreSQL – For scalable and structured data storage.
• JWT / OAuth Authentication – To enable secure user login and profile management.
• Cloud Storage (AWS S3 / Firebase) – For efficient image hosting and retrieval.
• WebSockets – To support real-time updates and notifications.

This project is more than just a showcase of technical ability—it reflects my structured approach to development, my understanding of user experience, and my ability to build interactive, responsive web applications.
