**Intro**

In this project, I created a web layout of a users' social media profile and image galaray. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Programing skills utilized**
Over the course of the project, I implemented the following web development skills in HTML and CSS:

- Media Quarries: I used media quarries, flex box, grid display, and DevTools to create a responsive design that can adapt to all media device screen widths e.g. desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
- I used the necessary styles in CSS to : 1. handle overflow of a single line of text 2. activate the finger-icon cursor response and other interactions to the user's mouse pointer and hover state over GUI elements 3. import and display images 4. import and dsiplay unique font styles from Google Fonts. 5. and create interactive user buttons for editing their social media page.
